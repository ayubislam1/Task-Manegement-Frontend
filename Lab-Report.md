## Introduction
The Task Management System is designed to facilitate efficient project management through organized tracking of tasks and team collaboration. This system enables users to create, manage, and monitor tasks across different stages of completion while providing team management capabilities. The system serves as a centralized platform where team members can coordinate their efforts, assign responsibilities, and track progress in real-time.

## Motivation
In modern collaborative work environments, effective task management and team coordination are critical for project success. Traditional methods of task tracking using physical boards or disconnected digital tools often lead to information silos, communication gaps, and inefficient workflows. This system was motivated by the need to:
- Centralize task information and team management in a single platform
- Provide real-time updates and status tracking
- Enhance team collaboration through role-based permissions
- Streamline the process of onboarding new team members
- Increase visibility into project progress and bottlenecks

## Problem Statement
Organizations face significant challenges in managing projects that involve multiple team members, varying task priorities, and complex dependencies. The key problems this system addresses include:

1. **Task Organization**: How to effectively organize and visualize tasks in various states of completion
2. **Team Coordination**: How to manage team member roles, permissions, and communication
3. **Progress Tracking**: How to monitor task progress and identify bottlenecks
4. **Resource Allocation**: How to efficiently assign and reassign tasks based on team capacity
5. **User Onboarding**: How to seamlessly integrate new team members into ongoing projects

## System Architecture
The Task Management System follows a modern client-server architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Architecture
- **React.js**: Core library for building the user interface
- **Context API**: State management for global application state
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time updates and notifications
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js/Express**: Server-side application framework
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing task and user data
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Email Service**: For sending invitations and notifications

### System Components
1. **Authentication Module**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
2. **Task Management Module**: Manages task creation, updates, and transitions
3. **Team Management Module**: Handles team member invitations, role changes, and permissions
4. **Dashboard Module**: Provides visualization and statistics of tasks and progress
5. **Notification System**: Alerts users of relevant changes and updates
